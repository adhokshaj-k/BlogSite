# How I Built My Home Lab

# 🏠 Building My Cybersecurity Home Lab

## Introduction
 I built my own home lab.For testing and learning purposes.

The goal was simple: create a controlled environment where I could safely practice scanning, exploitation, and privilege escalation without affecting real systems.

## My Lab Setup

Here is the setup I used:

- **Host System:** Windows 11
- **Hypervisor:** VirtualBox
- **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux
- **Target Machine:** Metasploitable 2
- **Network Configuration:** NAT Network (isolated but allows internet access via host)

### Resource Allocation

- Kali Linux → 4GB RAM
- Metasploitable 2 → 2GB RAM

Both virtual machines were placed on the same NAT Network to allow communication between them.

## Network Configuration

Proper isolation is critical in a home lab. I used **NAT Network mode**, which allows:

- Communication between virtual machines
- Internet access through the host
- No direct exposure to my home LAN

This ensures vulnerable machines are not accessible from outside the lab environment.

## Initial Connectivity Check

First, I verified connectivity between the machines:

```bash
ping <Metasploitable_IP>
```

Once confirmed, I performed a service scan using Nmap:

```bash
nmap -sV <Metasploitable_IP>
```

## Enumeration Results

The scan revealed multiple open ports including:

- 21 (FTP)
- 22 (SSH)
- 23 (Telnet)
- 80 (HTTP)
- 3306 (MySQL)

This demonstrated how exposed and outdated services increase the attack surface of a system.

## Exploitation Practice

During enumeration, I identified vulnerable services running on the target system.

Using Metasploit, I tested a known exploit module against a vulnerable service and successfully gained shell access to the target machine.

This helped me understand:

- Importance of version detection
- Mapping vulnerabilities to exploit modules
- Structured workflow: Scan → Enumerate → Exploit

## Future Improvements

To expand my lab, I plan to:

- Add a Windows machine for privilege escalation practice
- Set up an Active Directory lab
- Simulate basic SOC monitoring
- Practice web exploitation using OWASP Juice Shop

---

## Conclusion

Building my home lab significantly improved my practical understanding of penetration testing. Instead of just learning theory, I now practice exploitation and analysis in a safe, isolated environment.

The best way to learn cybersecurity is to build, test, break, and repeat — safely.
