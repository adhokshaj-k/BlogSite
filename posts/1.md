# How I Built My Home Lab

## Introduction

In the world of cybersecurity, theory is important, but practical experience is king. One of the best ways to gain that experience is by building a **Home Lab**. A home lab is a safe, isolated environment where you can practice penetration testing, malware analysis, and network defense without the risk of damaging real-world systems or breaking laws.

Whether you're studying for an ethical hacking certification or just curious about how systems work (and break), a home lab is your playground.

## Hardware Requirements

You don't need a supercomputer to get started, but virtualization does require some resources.

*   **CPU:** A modern multi-core processor (Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7) with **Virtualization Technology (VT-x/AMD-V)** enabled in the BIOS.
*   **RAM:** This is usually the bottleneck. **16GB** is a comfortable starting point. You can get by with 8GB, but you'll be limited to running 1-2 VMs at a time.
*   **Storage:** SSDs are highly recommended over HDDs for performance. You'll need enough space for multiple operating system ISOs and virtual disk files (at least 250GB-500GB free space).

## Hypervisor Selection

The heart of your lab is the **Hypervisor**—software that allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine.

*   **Type 2 Hypervisors (Hosted):** These run on top of your existing OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).
    *   *VirtualBox:* Free, open-source, and beginner-friendly.
    *   *VMware Workstation Player:* Free for personal use, generally faster than VirtualBox.
*   **Type 1 Hypervisors (Bare Metal):** These replace your OS entirely. Good if you have a dedicated spare computer.
    *   *Proxmox VE:* Excellent open-source option.
    *   *ESXi:* Industry standard, but has a steeper learning curve.

For beginners, I recommend starting with **VirtualBox** or **VMware Workstation Player** on your current computer.

## Essential Virtual Machines

A basic lab needs two teams: the Attackers and the Targets.

### The Attacker
*   **Kali Linux:** The industry standard for penetration testing. It comes pre-loaded with hundreds of tools like Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, and Wireshark.
*   **Parrot OS:** A popular alternative to Kali, often favored for being more lightweight.

### The Victims (Targets)
*   **Metasploitable 2/3:** Intentionally vulnerable Linux machines web applications designed to be hacked.
*   **OWASP Juice Shop:** A modern web application specifically designed with security flaws for practicing web exploitation.
*   **Windows 7 or 10:** You can download trial ISOs from Microsoft. Don't patch them if you want to test older exploits (like EternalBlue).
*   **VulnHub / HackTheBox:** You can download ready-made vulnerable VMs from sites like VulnHub to practice specific challenges.

## Network Configuration

Proper network isolation is critical. You don't want your vulnerable "victim" machines accessible from the internet, nor do you want your malware analysis experiments infecting your home Wi-Fi.

Most hypervisors offer these network modes:
1.  **NAT Network:** Creates a private network for your VMs. They can talk to each other and access the internet (via your host), but the internet can't access them. **This is the recommended setup for most labs.**
2.  **Bridged Adapter:** Connects the VM directly to your home LAN. Avoid this for vulnerable machines.
3.  **Host-Only:** Completely isolated network. VMs can talk to the host and each other, but have no internet access. Best for malware analysis.

## Getting Started: A Simple Workflow

1.  **Install VirtualBox.**
2.  **Download Kali Linux ISO** and create a new VM.
3.  **Download Metasploitable 2** and set it up as a second VM.
4.  **Configure Network:** Set both VMs to use the same "NAT Network" so they can ping each other.
5.  **Scan:** Use Nmap on Kali to discover ports on Metasploitable.
    ```bash
    nmap -sV <Metasploitable_IP>
    ```
6.  **Exploit:** Use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability found in the scan!

## Conclusion

Building a home lab is a journey. Start with a simple setup—one attacker, one victim—and grow from there. Add a firewall (like pfSense), set up an Active Directory environment, or try malware analysis. The most important thing is to keep experimenting and breaking things in your safe, controlled sandbox.

Happy Hacking!
